                The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England.
                The first international tournament for nations, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884 and included games between England, 
                Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a 
                demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics; however, the International Olympic Committee has retroactively 
                upgraded their status to official events, as well as the 1906 Intercalated Games.

               <p>After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside
                 the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906.
               These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as
                having been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official Olympic sport. Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's 
    football governing body, the 
event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great
 Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team)
 won the gold medals. They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.</p>

<p>With the Olympic event continuing to be a contest between amateur teams only, Sir Thomas Lipton organised 
    the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament
 was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each of which represented an
  entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup,
  and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused 
  to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team.</p>
  <p> Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and 
    returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title. Prior to the Lipton competition,
    from 1876 to 1904, games that were considered to be the "football world championship" were meetings between leading
     English and Scottish clubs, such as the 1895 game between Sunderland A.F.C. and the Heart of Midlothian F.C., which Sunderland won.</p>

<p>In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a "world football championship for amateurs", and took
     responsibility for managing the event.This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football 
competition for nations, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium.Uruguay won
 the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. Those were also the first two open world championships,
 as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era, and is the reason why Uruguay is allowed to wear 4 stars.</p>
